This is a cli tool written in C# that provides a brief summary of stock market performance for a specified time period. The tool fetches market data using OpenAI's API to generate insights based on the selected time frame.

Well at least thats what this thing was supposed to do until I found out gpt-4o can't fetch current day day trading data and any data that was returned was shit - not accurate at all. Rage quit but learned a ton while working on this. I still love you openai!
